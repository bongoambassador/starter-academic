I am a senior scientist working at the [University of Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at).

After studying physics in Innsbruck and the [University of Link√∂ping](https://liu.se/) I obtained my PhD. from the University of Innsbruck in 2016 in the field of experimental ion physics under the supervision of [Prof. Paul Scheier](https://www.uibk.ac.at/sp-physik/research-groups/p_scheier.html).

During my time as a PhD student I worked on cluster growth in helium nanodroplets and the behaviour of pristine helium droplets upon electron interactions.

In 2016 I started working with the research group [Microelectronics and Implantable Systems](https://www.uibk.ac.at/mechatronik/mikroelektronik/) at the [Department of Mechatronics](https://www.uibk.ac.at/mechatronik/). My main research interest is studying antenna design using evolutionary algorithms and exploring various application scenarios that are possible with this technique. I also work in the field of electromagnetic compatibility, where I perform product tests in our own anechoic chamber.

Feel free to connect with me via my professional networks or write me an e-mail. I am always open for collaborations!
