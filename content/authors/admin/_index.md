Welcome to my website! I am currently a senior scientist at the Department of Mechatronics at the University of Innsbruck working on the design of antennas using evolutionary algorithms. During my time as a PhD student at the Department of Ion Physics and Applied Physics I worked on cluster growth in helium nanodroplets and the behaviour of pristine helium droplets upon electron interactions.
